# About

This is a collection of tools bridging the gap between 3D skeletal keypoints and anything that consumes them.

The term ["rig"](doc/generated-rigs.md) is used to define the underlying structure of anything animatable, including humans skeletons, balls (considered a rig with single joint in center), independent objects, etc;
however, the focus is on creating hierarchical human skeletal rigs with well-defined root joints.

These tools can:
 - convert 3-dimensional keypoints into well-defined and kinematically-correct animatable rigs
 - package rigs into files for archival, sharing, or Internet streaming
 - import rigs into custom code, custom scripts, game engines, and animation software
 
These tools _cannot_ generate 3D keypoints from mocap suits, depth cameras, videos or images; instead they help visualize and process 3d keypoints after you have generated them.

Design goals for these tools include:
 - require minimum 3rd-party code dependencies for better portability. Distribute dependencies in build tree where possible but allow developers to choose their own dependencies
 - provide CMake builds for everything
 - detach core functionality and data definitions from animation software where possible, enabling flexibility of deployment and future use cases
 - run headless (no GUI) but include bindings for Blender, Unity, and others
 - design for both streaming (live) and static (download) use cases. This infers network bandwidth impact which is why I chose to encode the data
 - use kinematic techniques to interpolate joints that are difficult to label, such as mid-spine
 - use kinematic techniques to assign reasonable bone rolls when legs and arms are straight
 - avoid gimbal lock by performing quaternion calculations where possible
 - handle missing frames internally using SLERP between quaternion angles
 - filter noisy data without compromising full range of motion
 - use command-line arguments where possible (avoid hard-coded values), and print usage if ran without arguments
 - make use of design patterns
 - include basic error checking with human-readable messages
 - have well-commented code (open to interpretation)

# Workflow
![Workflow](img/workflow.png)

# Server-side
[**kp2rig**](doc/kp2rig.md) - C++ terminal application that imports a variety of 3D keypoints and produces unified animatable rigs, either as a monolithic JSON file or JSON file segments.
Depends on [Intel Integrated Performance Primitives (IPP)](https://software.intel.com/en-us/ipp), floating-point compression library [ZFP](https://computing.llnl.gov/projects/floating-point-compression), linear math library [Eigen](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page), json library [nlohmann](https://github.com/nlohmann/json), command-line parser library [CLI11](https://github.com/CLIUtils/CLI11).

# Client-side
[**rig2c**](doc/rig2c.md) - C API that forms the basis for any project consuming a rig. Builds for Windows, Linux, macOS, iOS, Android. Depends on floating-point compression library [ZFP](https://computing.llnl.gov/projects/floating-point-compression), json library [nlohmann](https://github.com/nlohmann/json).

**rig2py** - Python module (#import-able) for consuming rigs. Re-uses code from rig2c. Depends on [python](https://www.python.org/) >=3.5, particularly the C header and lib (python-dev)

**rig2swift** - Swift framework for consuming rigs. Statically links against rig2c. Tested on Mac Catalina and iOS.

**rig2cs** - C# scripts that dynamically wrap rig2c via P/Invoke

**rig2blender** - Python scripts and custom python module that imports rigs into Blender 2.8x.

# Samples
[**worldCoordinates**](samples/worldCoordinates/README.md) - Outputs rig keypoints to files as absolute Cartesian coordinates, and plots one of the frames.
Depends on python helper scripts from [rig2py](rig2py/py/), matplotlib, and mathutils

[**unityPackage**](unityPackage/SkeletonLoader_README.md) - If you have generated a rig2cs binary, and generated the sample JSON file from [**worldCoordinates**](samples/worldCoordinates/README.md), then you can take the contents within unityPackage folder and load it into your Unity Project.

# Tests
**rig2cTest** - C++ "catch" unit test for rig2c

**rig2csTest** - C# unit test for Windows

**rig2pyTest** - Python unit test for rig2py. Depends on [python](https://www.python.org/) >=3.5

**testIos** - Swift unit test for iOS
